State should be templated for a specific driver.
  This will enable compile-time optimizations for arrays of known, fixed-length (eg number of axis).
Furthermore, there may be machines for which there are multiple motor coordinates that map to any specific (X, Y, Z) pair.
  Therefore, relativeTimeOfNextStep should take MOTOR coordinates, not (x, y, z).
