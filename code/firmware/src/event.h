//There will be these events:
//  step forward (motor 0, 1, 2, 3)
//  step backward (motor 0, 1, 2, 3)
//Optionally:
//  read nozzle/bed temperature.
//    This is a potentially long process (time cap discharge).
//    Still want to have scheduler manage it, but shouldn't have it be in the event queue.
//  wait for temperature to stabilize.
//    This could be integrated into the event processing.
//      No - there are some movements which don't require bed to be heated (eg probing).
//    Could be done unbuffered?
//      yes - M116 is unbuffered.
